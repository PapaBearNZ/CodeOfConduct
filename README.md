# CodeOfConduct

Welcome!
 
This group was set up as a place for people to share their experiences with mental health, stress, anxiety and other non-diagnosed psychological conditions prevalent in the IT community.  
To achieve our lofty goals, we want you to be an active member of our group.  
All members are encouraged to contribute - we'd love to hear what you have to say!  
It's important to us that we create a safe and comfortable environment where you and others can be vulnerable and talk about your personal self without fear of retribution.  
With that in mind, we have some ground rules to cover.  

## Privacy
 
This group is a private space where people may discuss sensitive personal information.   
While it’s ok to talk about what was discussed in this meetup, please do not mention the names of participants in discussions without explicit permission (speakers aside).  
 
## No Harassment
 
We will not tolerate harassment of group members in any form.  
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.   
It also includes the use of sexual imagery, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.   
Members asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.  
 
## No Soliciting
 
This is not, specifically, a place for you to find a job.  
While we are all in the same industry, the purpose of this group is to come together to discuss mental health and associated topics - not to scout for jobs going.   
If you find yourself being pestered in this manner by a group member, please get in touch with a group organiser.  
If a group member is found engaging in this behaviour, we will take any action we deem appropriate, including warning them or removing them from the group.  
 
## Trigger Warnings
 
Due to the nature of our group, many people in this group will have in the past or currently be struggling with mental illness or other psychological issues, so please be mindful of that in your discussions.  
 
We will take steps to publicise in advance the topics that will be discussed at our events, so that group members are aware in advance of what will be discussed.  
 
## Breaches of the Code
 
If a group member engages in behaviour that breaches the code of conduct, we may take any action we deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the group.   
If you notice a breach of the code, or have any other concerns, please contact a group organiser immediately.  
 
If at any point during the meetup you notice a breach of the code of conduct, or you feel uncomfortable, you can:
- Raise your hand to flag the behaviour / conversation as inappropriate
- Contact a group organiser during or after the meetup
 
Secondarily, you are always welcome to leave any conversation, discussion or presentation if you feel uncomfortable - no questions asked.
 
## Not a Replacement for Professional Help
 
We will take steps where we can to offer links to professional counsellors and resources when we feel it is appropriate.  
Despite this, although this group is intended to help support those with mental illness and other related issues, it is important to note that we are not professional crisis counselors and are not a replacement for them.
 
## Lastly...
 
Thank you! Be caring, compassionate, helpful, positive, empathetic and we’ll all do awesome things together.
