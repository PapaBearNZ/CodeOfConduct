# Code of Conduct

For this group to be successful it is imperative that we create a safe 
and comfortable environment where you and others can be vulnerable and 
talk about your personal self without fear of retribution.                                                               
                                                           
To this end we feel it would be helpful to establish some guidelines for 
acceptable behaviour within the group.

This is intended to be a living document and is likely to evolve with 
community input as the group becomes more established.

## What is expected of group members?

0. #### No Harassment

   We will not tolerate harassment of group members in any form.  
   Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, 
   gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,disability, physical 
   appearance, body size, race, or religion.   
   
   It also includes the use of sexual imagery, deliberate intimidation, 
   stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained 
   disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, 
   and persistent unwelcome sexual attention.   
   
   Members asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply
   immediately.  

1. #### Be respectful

   It can take a lot of courage to share difficult experiences it is 
   important to be respectful of this and allow people to finish speaking 
   before asking questions or passing comment. 
  
   There will be occasions where you disagree with something that is said, 
   And it is fine to have a discussion about that as long as is it is done 
   in a way that doesn't minimalise anyone's feelings. 

2. #### Keep each others confidences

   This group is a private space where people may discuss sensitive 
   personal information. 
   While itâ€™s ok to talk about what was discussed in this meetup, please 
   do not mention the names or identifying characteristics of participants 
   in discussions without explicit permission (presenters aside).

3. #### This is not a place to do business

   While we are all in the same industry, the purpose of this group is 
   to come together to discuss mental health and associated topics.   
   This is not specifically a place to:

   - Scout for a job.
   - Recruit.
   - Sell products or services, or collect information for the 
   purposes of selling products or services.
   
   Networking that occurs in an organic way is fine, If you find 
   yourself being **pestered** in this manner by a group member, please 
   get in touch with a group organiser.  

4. #### Be mindful of sensitive content

   Due to the nature of our group, many people in this group will have 
   in the past or currently be struggling with mental illness or other 
   psychological issues, so please be mindful of that in your 
   discussions.  
   We will take steps to publicise in advance the topics that will be 
   discussed at our events, so that group members are aware in advance 
   of what will be discussed.

5. #### This is not a replacement for professional help
   This meetup intended to be a resource for those with mental illness and 
   other related issues. 
   But its important to remember that we are a group of IT professionals 
   not mental health professionals.
   It is important that you seek other avenue for help if you need it. 
   We are not professional crisis counselors and are not a replacement for 
   them.
   
   We will take steps where we can to provide information about treatment 
   options such as professional counsellors and resources when we feel it 
   is appropriate.

## What will happen if there is a breach of the Code

In most cases we would prefer to work with the parties involved to help 
them correct the inappropriate behaviour.
But for serious or persistent issues we will take any action we deem 
appropriate, to ensure the group can remain a safe environment.
This may include warning the offender or expulsion from the group.   


## What do I do if I feel there has been a breach of the code?

If you notice a breach of the code, or have any other concerns, please 
contact a group organiser immediately.  

If at any point during the meetup you notice a breach of the code of 
conduct, or you feel uncomfortable, you can:
- Raise your hand to flag the behaviour / conversation as inappropriate
- Contact a group organiser during or after the meetup

Secondarily, you are always welcome to leave any conversation, discussion 
or presentation if you feel uncomfortable - no questions asked.
